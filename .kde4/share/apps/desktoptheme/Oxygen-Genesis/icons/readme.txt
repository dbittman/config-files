PLASMA SYSTEM TRAY ICONS MATCHING THE OXYGEN THEME:
===================================================

*** BRING SOME COLOR INTO YOUR PLASMA >= 4.5.0 SYSTEM TRAY! ***

LICENSING:

All the icons except amarok.svgz are oxygen icons, drawn by the Oxygen Team,
license: see Oxygen-COPYING.txt

amarok.svgz license: see Amarok-icon-COPYING.txt

All files modified by Kevin Kofler to satisfy the technical requirements (object
labeling) for Plasma system tray icon themes,

I tried hard not to make any artistic changes to the Oxygen artwork, but still,
if something looks bad, it's probably my fault. ;-) I'm a developer, not an
artist, and I do not use Inkscape regularly.

INSTALLATION:

Copy the icons to ~/.kde/share/apps/desktoptheme/<yourtheme>/icons where
<yourtheme> is the folder name of the Plasma theme you are using ("default" for
the default Air theme). No other files should be needed.

NOTE ABOUT NOTIFICATION.SVGZ:

I intentionally didn't touch notification.svgz because the notifier is already
colored when active, and grayed out when inactive, which makes sense.
